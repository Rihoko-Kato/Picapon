**Contemplating Header Integration**

I'm currently focused on incorporating "Q&A" and a "Contact Form" links into the `index.html` header, ensuring responsiveness across PC and mobile views. The user's preference leans towards aligning with existing design elements, suggesting a focus on "Q&A" first. My immediate next step is to examine the existing structure and how best to integrate these new elements seamlessly.


**Assessing HTML Structure**

I've begun dissecting the `index.html` structure to understand the existing header's HTML framework. I'm focusing on identifying the current navigation elements, their classes, and any existing responsive design implementations. Once I've grasped the underlying HTML, I will move on to analyze the associated CSS styles and media queries.


**Reviewing Initial Implementation**

I'm examining the `index.html` file and noticing the "Q&A" and "Contact" sections have already been implemented, which aligns with the user's requirements. Further inspection is required to determine the quality of the implementation, but the presence of those elements is a good start. I'm focusing on the navigation structure and available content.


**Verifying Section Implementations**

I've confirmed the "Q&A" and "Contact" sections are present in the navigation of `index.html`. My next step involves verifying the corresponding sections exist and are correctly implemented within the document. I will also be looking into responsive design, specifically if a hamburger menu is already in place, or if I need to add one.


**Investigating Missing Sections**

I'm now diving into `index.html` to locate the "Q&A" and "Contact" sections, confirming their existence as linked to in the navigation. I suspect these might be missing, requiring their creation. I'll need to then examine `style.css` to review the mobile responsiveness, especially whether a hamburger menu is present and how the header behaves on smaller screens. I need to make sure both desktop and mobile layouts are handled.


**Assessing Section Presence**

I'm now focusing on `index.html`, where I see the navigation links for "Q&A" and "Contact." However, I must now verify the actual presence of the corresponding sections within the document. I need to make sure the links are functional and lead to the correct content. After that, I will investigate the responsiveness, specifically the presence of a mobile menu. I need to see if a hamburger menu exists, and how the header behaves on smaller screens.


**Reviewing the HTML File**

I've checked the contents of `index.html`. I've found that the FAQ section, `#faq`, already exists starting on line 113. However, the contact section, `#contact`, is missing. The header navigation includes `<li><a` elements.


**Analyzing the Requirements**

I've determined I need to add a contact section, `#contact`, to `index.html` after the existing FAQ section. My next step will be to implement a hamburger menu for mobile devices, since the current navigation is just `<ul>` and `<nav>` elements, lacking a toggle button. This must be implemented in `index.html`. Furthermore, I'll need to style the `#contact` section and header for mobile devices within `style.css`. Before starting, I'll review `style.css` to check the current responsiveness.
